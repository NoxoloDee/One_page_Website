              <h3>Explore East Asia</h3>

              <p>The backpacking trail through Southeast Asia is well worn. People have been traveling it since the 1970s. Starting in beautiful Thailand, the trail makes its way to up-and-coming Laos, through Vietnam, and through the temples of Angkor Wat. It then heads back into Thailand, where people head south to party in the Thai Islands before moving down to into Malaysia and Singapore. There are a few variations on the trail but this is what it mostly covers. The warm months of November-April draw the biggest crowds. Everyone is escaping the cold in Europe, and it’s not too hot in the region. Despite the vastness of the region, the tourist trail is much more uniform in many ways than Europe. Prices can be quite similar in places, transportation types don’t vary too much, and general travel advice is usually the same. Accommodation in Southeast Asia is really cheap. You can find dorm rooms for as little as 8,000-20,000 KHR or 16,000-40,500 LAK ($2-5 USD) in parts of Cambodia and Laos.</p>

            <h3>Africa: Kenya - Big Five safaris</h3>

            <p>Despite having a coastline of beautiful beaches perfect for lazing, Kenya rarely inspires visitors to sit still – there are simply too many exciting things to experience. 
            Stirring landscapes, ranging from equatorial glaciers and jagged peaks to wildlife-laden plains and tropical reefs, provide an epic natural playground for all who venture here, while the many intoxicating cultures surprise at each and every turn. Not only were safaris born in Kenya, but so was the very word itself – it means 
            ‘journey’ in Swahili. Spotting the much-heralded Big Five (lion, leopard, buffalo, rhino and elephant) is a major aspiration of many visitors to Africa, and as one would suspect, Kenya provides some of the continent’s most impressive natural venues for it. None of which is more famous than the Masai Mara, where sightings of all these species is common. Lake Nakuru National Park, with its flamingo-lined 
            lake and forest-clad escarpments, is another incredible place for Big Five safaris, as is Amboseli National Park, where Mt Kilimanjaro provides a staggering backdrop. Samburu Game Reserve in the remote north is prime safari territory too, and also hosts its own ‘Samburu Big Five’: Beisa onyx, Grevy’s zebra, long-necked gerenuk, reticulated giraffe and Somali ostrich.</p><img src="images/explore-south-africa.jpg">

              <p>Overall the last 40 days I've been on Forever young have been incredible! Not only do you learn so much about the culture in south east Asia, it also gives such an amazing opportunity to learn more about yourself. FY is also a really sweet way to meet new people, from tons of different backgrounds who some how mesh together and it forms a new family. I wouldn't change this experience for the world and I am so grateful for the friends and memories I gained along the way!</p>

            <p>Great trip with plenty of days to see everything and still have lots of down time to relax. Dom and Shayla were organized, attentive, and always managed to find things for the group to do. Some long travel days but the private minibusses used were usually comfortable enough with stops to get out and stretch your legs.</p><img src="images/traveler.jpeg">
